do files always have the same metadata elements structure? I'm referring to the attributes that come before the "ReadingList" element (MeterPointId, Timestamps, FlowDirection, etc)

Do files always have the same number of Readings?

My take on this task is to create two columns per Reading: Reading_{Sequence_number}_Quantity and Reading_{Sequence_number}_Value. Is this alright or does the content need to be stored in a different way?

regarding the reception of the files, do I have to address the way we would received them? Do we get the 5.000 files all at once at an specific time of the day, or do we need to process them on real time / streaming?

Would they be placed on a cloud service such as an S3 bucket? Or for now I can just assume we have them in a local folder?
